# [Japanese Souffle Pancake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGJ7o4oFe0)

1. 2 Egg Yolks (from eggs that weigh 58-60 gr. each with shell)
2. 20 gr. Full Milk / Whole Milk
3. 10 gr. Vegetable Oil
Mix the three things util a lot of air bubble appear 

then add Vanilla
4. 1/4 tsp. Vanilla Essence
Continue mixing till light and foamy

then add flour
5. 30 gr. All purpose Flour
pay attention to the batter consistency


6. 3 Egg Whites (from eggs that weigh 58-60 gr. each with shell)
7. 1 tsp. White Vinegar
8. 40 gr. Fine Sugar
add Vinegar to Egg Whites and start mix by machine
then add sugar in 2 times, mix it to white and smooth

add mixed egg white to the batter and mix them to foamy
pay attention to the batter consistency

*After the cake batter is made, you need to use it all at once. Otherwise the batter will become runny due to lack of sugar content in the meringue.
This recipe only uses 40 gr. of sugar.

As we all know, meringue produces water after awhile, and your cake batter becomes runny. To fix that you can use more sugar.
30 gr. sugar - 1 egg white
90 gr. sugar - 3 egg whites*

Cook Step:
1. Heat up your pan in low heat before applying oil.(Remeber use low heat or fire!)
2. Put the bat on your pan in size you like.
3. Cover the pan
4. After 3 to 4 minutes, depending on your fire. You need to test it out yourself. No one can tell you how long it will takes according to your own cooking stoves.
5. switch top and bottom of the batter.
6. After 3 to 4 minutes. Again, the timing is based on my stove.
