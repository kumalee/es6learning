# Custom DNS Records

## A Record - IPV4 dns
by changing the А record (address record) on IPv4 networks you can easily redirect your host from one IP to another;

## AAAA Record - IPV6 dns
empowers you to redirect hostnames to an IP address of your host’s if your network uses IPv6

## CNAME Record - Redirect current host to another host
you can use this record in case you wish to direct your host not to an IP address but to another host instead. It is very useful when running multiple services on different ports from a single IP address. CNAME records are most commonly used to point the "www" subdomain to the actual domain name;

## TXT Record
allowing you to insert arbitrary text into a DNS record, this record can be used to implement the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for validating the legitimacy of incoming email from a certain domain;

## MX Record - Mail Server
this record gives you the flexibility to easily indicate the IP address of the mail server for each of your hosts;

## SRV Record - VOIP
by editing this record, users providing VOIP and other specific services are able to specify a port and other specific system information concerning their offerings;
