        A big box arrives at your door and it contains a desk in many pieces which you must assemble. Do you pull out the written directions and read them step by step? You might be a Visual/Verbal Learner. Or, perhaps you study the diagram and then proceed to assemble the desk. In this case, you might be a Visual/Nonverbal Learner. If you skip the directions and diagram and just start putting the desk together, figuring things out as you go, you may be a Tactile/Kinesthetic Learner. Want to work with a buddy and the two of you talk your way through the task? You might be an Auditory/Verbal Learner.

## [Effective Study Habits](https://psychcentral.com/lib/top-10-most-effective-study-habits/)
1. How you approach studying matters.
    
    Aim to think positively when you study, and remind yourself of your skills and abilities.
2. Outline and rewrite your notes.
3. Use memory games (mnemonic devices).
    
    The key to such memory devices is the new phrase or sentence you come up with has to be more memorable and easier to remember than the terms or information you’re trying to learn. These don’t work for everyone, so if they don’t work for you, don’t use them.
4. Practice by yourself or with friends.

    practice exams, past quizzes, or flash cards

    * Work lots of practice problems (your go-to strategy for math)
    * Make mind maps or Venn diagrams

## [Mind Maps A Powerful Approach to Note-Taking](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newISS_01.htm)
Mind Maps are useful for:

* Brainstorming   – individually, and as a group.
* Summarizing information.
* Taking notes.
* Consolidating information from different sources.
* Thinking through complex problems.
* Presenting information clearly.
* Studying and memorizing information

Using Mind Maps Effectively:
* Use Single Words or Uncomplicated Phrases – Keep things simple.
* Print Words – They will be easier to read than joined-up or indistinct writing.
* Use Color to Separate Different Ideas – Color can help to show the organization of the subject. 
* Use Symbols and Images – Pictures can help you to remember information more effectively than words
* Using Cross-Linkages – Information in one part of a Mind Map may relate to another part, so draw lines to show these cross-linkages. This will help you to see how one part of the subject affects another.
