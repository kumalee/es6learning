# See what to include in a cover letter:

1. Your Personal Info, Contact Details & Date

    Must-haves include your `name`, `email address`, and `phone number`. Nice-to-haves are your mailing address, branding statement, and a LinkedIn profile. End your cover letter header by inserting the date of writing before moving on.

    *Pro Tip:  Don’t add the rest of your social links, profile URLs, and portfolio information with your contact details as you did on your resume, unless the cover letter template you choose includes an area for them.*

2. The Details of the Company You're Applying to

    Immediately after the date, it’s time to add the addressee. In your case, it’s a company, but try to find the specific name of the hiring manager or HR director to insert at the top of the company address. This will make it feel more personalized and will be much more compelling.

3. A Professional Salutation (Formal Greeting)

    One of the best cover letter tips out there is to call them by name. Something like, “Dear Ms. Srivastava,” will work just perfectly. Using a title and their last name is formal and fine, but you can also grab their attention by calling them by their first name: “Dear Jacqueline,”.

    Now, what about that “Dear” part? **Dear is regarded as one of the best cover letter salutations out there,** as it is useful whether the letter is formal or informal, and whether you know their name or not.


4. An Introduction with Your Skills and Professional Wins to Grab the Recruiter's Attention

    Sample:
    ```
    As a longtime fan of United Airlines’ peerless flying experience, I was excited to see the opening for long-haul flight attendants. With my experience as an award-winning flight attendant for Lufthansa, I know I can use my skill set and knowledge to become a valuable member of the United Airlines team.
    ```

    *Pro Tip: As you called out their name in the greeting, mention the company’s name in the opening paragraph, as well. It feel more personalized, and it ensures the recruiter that this is a dedicated cover letter, not one you mass-emailed all over the continent.*

5. Reasons You’re a Perfect Fit for the Job

    You’ve got them hooked, now start reeling them in with your second paragraph. In the second paragraph of a cover letter, show them how you are the perfect fit for the company and team.

    Sample
    ```
    In my current position as a residential painter, I’ve had many responsibilities and achievements that would serve me well as a future Koffee Konsultants barista. Completing painting jobs all around Manhattan gives me a unique sense of speedy work under high pressure while maintaining quality, something that can translate easily into the fast-paced positions at your cafes. On top of that, my numerous clients have always maintained that I exuded a sense of professionalism while remaining warm and friendly in conversation during jobs, which would be useful in the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the Koffee Konsultants cafe.
    ```

    *Pro Tip: As the items in this middle paragraph are of significant importance to the company and hiring manager, don’t afraid to make this one longer than the rest.*

6. Reasons the Company is a Perfect Fit for You

    Now you’re over the hump, but you still got a little ways to go before the end. For the third paragraph, explain to them why their company and this position in particular is perfect for you.

    Sample
    ```
    Obtaining the head chef position would be my dream come true. I’ve long been a fan of the seafood dishes you serve and the wines you suggest. In fact, Bahari’s peerless menu is what caused me to study Greek cuisine to begin with. Though I love cooking with all my heart, there is no other restaurant that would make me as happy to work for. I know, should I be honored with the position, that I’d be the envy of the neighborhood as Bahari’s head chef!
    ```

    *Pro Tip: Let your hair down and wear your heart on your sleeve. Skip the robotic tone for the resume, and convey your enthusiasm and excitement for the position here in this third paragraph!*

7. A Strong Closing Paragraph with a Compelling Call to Action

    Sample
    ```
    I would welcome the chance to discuss your digital marketing objectives and show you how my successes at ABC can translate into digital and online marketing growth for XYZ.
    ```

    *Pro Tip: How long should a cover letter be? Keep it down to no more than the areas we’ve talked about here. It shouldn’t near a page in length and definitely not a 2-page cover letter!*

8. A Professional Closing Sentiment & Your Name 

    Sample
    ```
    Sincerely,
    John Smith
    ```

    *Pro Tip: You can let loose a bit in your cover letter, but just as with the formal header, where you structured your address and theirs, keep the closing sentiment more formal.*

9. A Postscript at the Bottom of Your Cover Letter to Seal the Deal

    Sample
    ```
    P.S. I’d love the opportunity to sit down with you and go over how I can bring similar results (12% productivity increase) to your office, as well.
    ```

    *A P.S. (postscript) at the bottom of your cover letter always draws the attention of the reader, even if they don’t care to read the rest of it.*

# What’s the Best Format for a Web Developer Cover Letter?

* Your contact details so they don’t get a 404 when replying
* The date of writing
* The startup’s or company’s details in business format
* A salutation (e.g., Dear Ms. Stanley,)

    WRONG
    
    *~~Dear sir or madam,~~*
    
    **RIGHT**

    Dear Monique,
* A compelling introductory statement
* A paragraph about why you’re the perfect dev for hire
* A paragraph on why this particular developer job is ideal for you
* A closing statement with a strong call to action
    
    WRONG
    
    *~~I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible, thanks.~~*
    
    **RIGHT**
    
    I would enjoy an opportunity to chat about your upcoming projects and plans and share with you how my achievements at Brooklyn Media can be replicated and improved at Steinway Solutions.
* A valediction (e.g., Sincerely) and your John Hancock
* Optionally, a postscript (P.S.) after your signature

    P.S. Perhaps we could meet for a coffee at the Astoria Cafe a block away from your office? I would love to discuss how we can get similar results to the 50% code efficiency increase!

    *This example gives a nice human touch to the often-drab banality of the regular cover letter. It also adds one more achievement there for more pop.*

# The Best Software Engineer Cover Letter Template—Checklist

1. Heading
 
    Your names, professional title, and contact info.
    The addressee's details.
    City and date are optional and a tad old-school, but more conservative readers will appreciate them.
 
2. Salutation
 
    “Dear Hiring Manager” is okay(ish.)
    “Dear [Hiring Manager’s name] is perfect.
    “Dear Sir or Madam” is stiff, boring, and really old-fashioned.
 

3. Main Body: The Three-Paragraph Software Engineer Cover Letter Format
 
    Begin with “the hook.” Tell your employers a quick story that shows how impressive your skills are.
    Make an offer. Emphasize how your expertise will help solve their problems. Use bullet points to outline your achievements.
    Explain your motivation. Once they understand they want you, they’ll want to know why you want them.
 

4. Call To Action
 
    Reiterate your offer and ask them to reach out to you.
    Gently remind them that you’re not going to be available forever.
    Don’t write the hackneyed phrase “Thank you for your time and attention.”
 

5. Formal Closing

    Use a “sincerely” synonym.
    Don’t get too informal.
    Sign-off with your full name
 

6. The Postscript
 
    It works like an eye magnet.
    Everyone will read it.
    In it, include something you can’t afford for your prospective employer to miss.
