  <p>The One Where It All Began (Pilot) There's nothing to tell.</p>
  <p> It's just some guy I work with.</p>
  <p> You're going out with the guy.</p>
  <p> There has to be something wrong with him.</p>
  <p> All right, Joey.</p>
  <p> Be nice.</p>
  <p> So does he have a hump and a hairpiece? Wait, does he eat chalk? I don't want her to go through what I did with Carl.</p>
  <p> Okay, everybody relax.</p>
  <p> This is not even a date.</p>
  <p> It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.</p>
  <p> Sounds like a date to me.</p>
  <p> I'm in high school, in the cafeteria.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> and I realize I'm totally naked.</p>
  <p> I've had that dream.</p>
  <p> Then I look down and I realize there is a phone.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> there.</p>
  <p> - Instead of - That's right! Never had that one.</p>
  <p> All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.</p>
  <p> What do I do? Everyone starts looking at me.</p>
  <p> They weren't looking at you before? Finally, I figure I'd better answer it.</p>
  <p> And it turns out it's my mother.</p>
  <p> Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.</p>
  <p> Hi.</p>
  <p> He says, "Hello," I want to kill myself.</p>
  <p> You okay? I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> - and tied it around my neck.</p>
  <p> - Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today.</p>
  <p> - Let me get you some coffee.</p>
  <p> - Thanks.</p>
  <p> No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.</p>
  <p> - Just leave my aura alone, okay? - Fine, be murky.</p>
  <p> - I'll be fine.</p>
  <p> I hope she'll be happy.</p>
  <p> - No, you don't.</p>
  <p> No, I don't.</p>
  <p> To hell with her.</p>
  <p> She left me! You never knew she was a lesbian? No! Okay? Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know.</p>
  <p> How should I know? Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.</p>
  <p> Did I say that out loud? I told Mom and Dad last night.</p>
  <p> They took it pretty well.</p>
  <p> Oh, really? So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> "I'll never have grandchildren," was what? A wrong number? Sorry.</p>
  <p> Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.</p>
  <p> You're angry.</p>
  <p> You're hurting.</p>
  <p> Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joints! Hey, you're single.</p>
  <p> Have some hormones.</p>
  <p> But I don't want to be single, okay? I just want to be married again.</p>
  <p> And I just want a million dollars! - Rachel? - Oh, Monica! Thank God! I went to your building.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> and a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are.</p>
  <p> - Can I get you some coffee? - Decaf.</p>
  <p> Everybody, this is Rachel, a Lincoln High survivor.</p>
  <p> This is everybody.</p>
  <p> Chandler and Phoebe.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> Joey.</p>
  <p> Remember my brother, Ross? Sure! You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.</p>
  <p> I was in the room with all the presents.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.</p>
  <p> When all of a sudden Sweet 'N Low? I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry.</p>
  <p> I got freaked out, and it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr.</p>
  <p> Potato Head.</p>
  <p> I always knew he looked familiar, but.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> I had to get out of there, and I started wondering.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> "Why am I doing this," and "Who am I doing it for?" I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> but you're the only person I know here.</p>
  <p> - Who wasn't invited to the wedding.</p>
  <p> - I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.</p>
  <p> I guess he bought her the pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.</p>
  <p> "Tuna or egg salad! Decide!" "I'll have whatever Christina's having.</p>
  <p>" Daddy, I just I can't marry him.</p>
  <p> I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> I just don't love him.</p>
  <p> Well, it matters to me! "If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.</p>
  <p>" She should not be wearing those pants.</p>
  <p> Push her down the stairs! Push her! Push her down the stairs! Come on, Daddy, listen! All my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe!" "You're a shoe!" What if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a purse? Or a hat? No, I don't want
    you to buy me a hat! It's a metaphor, Daddy! You can see where he'd have trouble.</p>
  <p> Look, Daddy, it's my life.</p>
  <p> Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.</p>
  <p> I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.</p>
  <p> Well, maybe that's my decision.</p>
  <p> Maybe I don't need your money.</p>
  <p> Wait! I said maybe! Just breathe.</p>
  <p> That's it.</p>
  <p> Try to think of nice, calm things.</p>
  <p> Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens La la la something And noodles with string I'm all better now.</p>
  <p> I helped.</p>
  <p> This is probably for the best.</p>
  <p> Independence.</p>
  <p> Controlling your life.</p>
  <p> The whole hat thing.</p>
  <p> You can always come to Joey.</p>
  <p> Me and Chandler live across the hall.</p>
  <p> He's away a lot.</p>
  <p> Stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day.</p>
  <p> Like there's a rule, or something? I got it.</p>
  <p> Please don't do that again.</p>
  <p> It's a horrible sound.</p>
  <p> It's Paul.</p>
  <p> Oh, God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in.</p>
  <p> - Who's Paul? - Paul, the wine guy? Maybe.</p>
  <p> Your "not a real date" is with Paul, the wine guy? - He finally asked you out? - Yes! It's a "Dear Diary" moment.</p>
  <p> - Rach, I can cancel.</p>
  <p> - Please, go, I'll be fine.</p>
  <p> Ross, are you okay? Do you want me to stay? That'd be good.</p>
  <p> - Really?- Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy! Does he sell it, drink it? Or he just complains a lot? Hi, come in! Paul, this is.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> everybody.</p>
  <p> Everybody, this is Paul.</p>
  <p> - The wine guy.</p>
  <p> - I didn't catch your name.</p>
  <p> Paul? I'll be right back.</p>
  <p> I've just gotta go A-wandering? Change.</p>
  <p> Sit down.</p>
  <p> Two seconds.</p>
  <p> I just pulled out four eyelashes.</p>
  <p> That can't be good.</p>
  <p> Hey, Paul, here's a tip.</p>
  <p> She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> until it starts to get red.</p>
  <p> Shut up, Joey! What are you up to tonight? I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> so, nothing.</p>
  <p> Right.</p>
  <p> You're not even getting your honeymoon.</p>
  <p> Although, Aruba.</p>
  <p> This time of year? Talk about your.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> big lizards.</p>
  <p> If you don't want to be alone tonight.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.</p>
  <p> We're very excited about it.</p>
  <p> Thanks.</p>
  <p> But I'm just going to hang out here.</p>
  <p> - It's been a long day.</p>
  <p> - Oh, sure.</p>
  <p> Phoebe, wanna help? I wish I could, but I don't want to.</p>
  <p> Love is sweet as summer showers Love is a wondrous work of art But your love Oh, your love, your love Is like a giant pigeon Crapping on my heart Thank you.</p>
  <p> I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> using a bunch of these little worm guys.</p>
  <p> I have no bracket-y thing.</p>
  <p> I see no worm guys whatsoever.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> and I cannot feel my legs.</p>
  <p> - We got a bookcase.</p>
  <p> - It's beautiful.</p>
  <p> What's this? I would have to say that is an L-shaped bracket.</p>
  <p> - Which goes where? - I have no idea.</p>
  <p> - Done with the bookcase.</p>
  <p> - All finished.</p>
  <p> This was Carol's favorite beer.</p>
  <p> She always drank it out of the can.</p>
  <p> I should have known.</p>
  <p> - Start with that, we're out of here.</p>
  <p> - Please don't spoil all this fun.</p>
  <p> Let me ask you.</p>
  <p> She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.</p>
  <p> What did you get? - You guys.</p>
  <p> - You got screwed.</p>
  <p> - Oh, my God.</p>
  <p> - I know.</p>
  <p> I'm such an idiot.</p>
  <p> I should've known when she went to the dentist five times a week.</p>
  <p> I mean, how clean can teeth get? My brother's going through that.</p>
  <p> How did you get over it? He might accidentally break something valuable of hers.</p>
  <p> - Say her - Leg? That's one way of doing it.</p>
  <p> I went for the watch.</p>
  <p> You actually broke her watch? The worst I ever did was shred my old boyfriend's favorite towel.</p>
  <p> - Steer clear of you.</p>
  <p> - That's right.</p>
  <p> Barry, I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> I am so sorry.</p>
  <p> You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.</p>
  <p> It's about me.</p>
  <p> And I just The machine cut me off again.</p>
  <p> Anyway.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs.</p>
  <p> Barry Finkel.</p>
  <p> But it isn't me.</p>
  <p> It's not me.</p>
  <p> Not that I have any idea who "me" is right now, but you just I'm divorced.</p>
  <p> - I'm only 26, and I'm divorced! - Shut up! That only took me an hour.</p>
  <p> We haven't had a relationship that's lasted longer than a Mento.</p>
  <p> You have had the love of a woman for four years.</p>
  <p> Four years of closeness and sharing, after which she ripped your heart out.</p>
  <p> That is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point! Know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody? I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.</p>
  <p> What are you talking about? One woman.</p>
  <p> That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream.</p>
  <p> Let me tell you something.</p>
  <p> There's lots of flavors out there.</p>
  <p> Rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.</p>
  <p> You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.</p>
  <p> It's the best thing to happen to you! You got married.</p>
  <p> You were like, what, 8? Welcome back to the world.</p>
  <p> Grab a spoon! - I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.</p>
  <p> - Then stay out of my freezer.</p>
  <p> Ever since she walked out on me.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> What? You wanna spell it out with noodles? It's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.</p>
  <p> So there's going to be a fifth date? Isn't there? Yeah, yeah.</p>
  <p> I think there is.</p>
  <p> What were you going to say? Ever since she left me.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> I haven't been able to perform.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> sexually.</p>
  <p> Oh, God! I'm so sorry.</p>
  <p> Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.</p>
  <p> How long? - Two years.</p>
  <p> - Wow.</p>
  <p> I'm glad you smashed her watch.</p>
  <p> So you still think you might want that fifth date? Yeah.</p>
  <p> Yeah, I do.</p>
  <p> We are gathered here to join Joanie Louise Cunningham.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> and Charles.</p>
  <p> Chachi, Chachi, Chachi.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> in the bonds of holy matrimony.</p>
  <p> See! But Joanie loved Chachi.</p>
  <p> That's the difference.</p>
  <p> "Grab a spoon.</p>
  <p>" Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon? Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you? Great story.</p>
  <p> But I gotta go.</p>
  <p> I got a date with Andrea.</p>
  <p> Angela.</p>
  <p> No, Andrea.</p>
  <p> Andrea's the screamer.</p>
  <p> Angela has cats.</p>
  <p> Right, thanks.</p>
  <p> It's Julie.</p>
  <p> I'm out of here.</p>
  <p> Here's the thing.</p>
  <p> Even if I could get it together enough.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> to ask a woman out.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> who am I going to ask? Isn't this amazing? I've never made coffee in my life.</p>
  <p> - That is amazing.</p>
  <p> - Congratulations.</p>
  <p> If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.</p>
  <p> I think it's, "If I can invade Poland, there's nothing I can't do.</p>
  <p>" If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> Although, actually I'm really not that hungry.</p>
  <p> Oh, good.</p>
  <p> Lenny and Squiggy are here.</p>
  <p> - Good morning.</p>
  <p> - Good morning.</p>
  <p> - Morning.</p>
  <p> - Morning, Paul.</p>
  <p> - Hello, Paul.</p>
  <p> - Hi.</p>
  <p> Paul, is it? - Thank you so much.</p>
  <p> - Stop.</p>
  <p> Last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> plus the barn-raising scene in Witness.</p>
  <p> We'll talk later.</p>
  <p> Thank you.</p>
  <p> That wasn't a real date.</p>
  <p> What the hell do you do on a real date? Shut up and put my table back.</p>
  <p> I've got to get to work.</p>
  <p> If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.</p>
  <p> So, like, you guys all have jobs? Yeah, we all have jobs.</p>
  <p> That's how we buy stuff.</p>
  <p> - Yeah, I'm an actor.</p>
  <p> - Have I seen you in anything? I doubt it.</p>
  <p> Mostly regional work.</p>
  <p> Unless you saw the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> at the little theater in the park? It was a job! "Look, Geppetto.</p>
  <p> I'm a real live boy.</p>
  <p>" - I will not take this abuse.</p>
  <p> - You're right, I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy You should both know that he's a dead man.</p>
  <p> Oh, Chandler! How are you doing today? Sleep okay? Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.</p>
  <p> I see that.</p>
  <p> You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.</p>
  <p> I know.</p>
  <p> He's just so.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> - Remember you and Tony Demarco? - Oh, yeah.</p>
  <p> Well, it's like that.</p>
  <p> With feelings.</p>
  <p> - Wow, are you in trouble! - Big time! Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.</p>
  <p> I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.</p>
  <p> I'm going to get up, go to work, and not think about him all day.</p>
  <p> Or else I'm going to get up and go to work.</p>
  <p> - Wish me luck! - What for? I'm gonna go get one of those job things.</p>
  <p> - Hi, Monica.</p>
  <p> - Franny, welcome back.</p>
  <p> - How was Florida? - You had sex, didn't you? - How do you do that? - I hate you.</p>
  <p> I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.</p>
  <p> So, who? You know Paul? Paul, the wine guy? Yeah, I know Paul.</p>
  <p> You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul? What? I take credit for Paul.</p>
  <p> Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.</p>
  <p> Of course it was a line.</p>
  <p> Why would anybody do something like that? I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than: "To get you into bed.</p>
  <p>" I hate men.</p>
  <p> Don't hate.</p>
  <p> You don't want to put that out into the universe.</p>
  <p> Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> and men with emotional problems can hear? Come here.</p>
  <p> Give me your feet.</p>
  <p> I just thought he was nice, you know? I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.</p>
  <p> - Guess what? - You got a job? Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing.</p>
  <p> - I was laughed out of 12 interviews.</p>
  <p> - You're surprisingly upbeat.</p>
  <p> You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> How well you know me.</p>
  <p> They're my "I don't need a job.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> I've got great boots" boots.</p>
  <p> - How did you pay? - Credit card.</p>
  <p> And who pays for that? My father.</p>
  <p> Is this really necessary? I can stop charging any time.</p>
  <p> You can't live off your parents.</p>
  <p> I know that.</p>
  <p> That's why I was getting married.</p>
  <p> Give her a break.</p>
  <p> It's hard being on your own.</p>
  <p> Thank you.</p>
  <p> I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14.</p>
  <p> Mom had killed herself, stepdad was in jail.</p>
  <p> I didn't know anybody here.</p>
  <p> I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields.</p>
  <p> And then he killed himself.</p>
  <p> Then I found aromatherapy.</p>
  <p> So I know exactly how you feel.</p>
  <p> The word you're looking for is: "Anyway.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>" - You ready? - No, how can I be ready? "Ready to jump out of the plane with no parachute?" - I can't do this.</p>
  <p> - I know you can.</p>
  <p> - No.</p>
  <p> - You made coffee, you can do anything.</p>
  <p> Cut.</p>
  <p> Cut.</p>
  <p> Cut.</p>
  <p> You know what? I think we can leave it at that.</p>
  <p> - Kind of a symbolic gesture.</p>
  <p> - Rachel, that was a library card.</p>
  <p> If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.</p>
  <p> Welcome to the real world! It sucks.</p>
  <p> You're gonna love it.</p>
  <p> That's it.</p>
  <p> Are you going to crash on the couch? - No, I gotta go home sometime.</p>
  <p> - Are you gonna be okay? Look what I just found on the floor.</p>
  <p> What? That's Paul's watch.</p>
  <p> Just put it back where you found it.</p>
  <p> Oh, boy! All right.</p>
  <p> - Good night, everybody.</p>
  <p> - Good night.</p>
  <p> - I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> Have it, I don't want it.</p>
  <p> - Split it? You probably didn't know this, but in high school.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p> I had a major crush on you.</p>
  <p> I knew.</p>
  <p> You did? I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.</p>
  <p> I did.</p>
  <p> Listen, do you think.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>? Try not to let my vulnerability become a factor here.</p>
  <p> Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime? Yeah.</p>
  <p> Maybe.</p>
  <p> Okay.</p>
  <p> Okay, maybe I will.</p>
  <p> - Good night.</p>
  <p> - Good night.</p>
  <p> See you.</p>
  <p> Wait, wait.</p>
  <p> What's with you? I just grabbed a spoon.</p>
  <p> - I can't believe what I'm hearing.</p>
  <p> - Can't believe what I'm hearing - What? I said - What? I said - Would you stop? - Was I doing it again? Yes! I said you had a nice butt.</p>
  <p> It's just not a great butt.</p>
  <p> - You won't know a butt if it bit you.</p>
  <p> - There's an image.</p>
  <p> Would anybody like more coffee? You made it, or you're serving it? - I'm just serving it.</p>
  <p> - I'll have a cup of coffee.</p>
  <p> Kids, new dream.</p>
  <p> I'm in Las Vegas.</p>
  <p> Miss, more coffee? Could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead.</p>
  <p> Thank you.</p>
  <p> Sorry.</p>
  <p> Okay, Las Vegas.</p>
  <p> I'm in Las Vegas.</p>
  <p> I'm Liza Minnelli.</p>
  <p>.</p>
