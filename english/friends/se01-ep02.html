    <p>You don't understand.</p>
    <p>For us, kissing is as important as any part.</p>
    <p>Yeah, right! You serious? Oh, yeah.</p>
    <p>- Everything is in that first kiss.</p>
    <p>- Absolutely.</p>
    <p>For us, kissing's an opening act.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>like the comedian you have to sit through.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>before Pink Floyd comes out.</p>
    <p>And it's not that we don't like the comedian.</p>
    <p>It's just that that's not why we bought the ticket.</p>
    <p>The problem is, no matter how great the show was.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>you girls are looking for the comedian again.</p>
    <p>We're in the car, fighting traffic, just trying to stay awake.</p>
    <p>Word of advice: Bring back the comedian.</p>
    <p>Or next time you'll find yourself listening to that album alone.</p>
    <p>
      Are we still talking about sex? The One With the Sonogram at the End No,
      it's good.
    </p>
    <p>It is good.</p>
    <p>It's just that Doesn't she seem a little angry? Well, she has issues.</p>
    <p>Does she? Try to live with "Mr.</p>
    <p>I'm Evolving.</p>
    <p>
      " He's out while she's home getting the mastodon smell out of the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>Marsha, see, these are cave people.</p>
    <p>
      Okay, they have issues like: "Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close.
    </p>
    <p>" Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? - No.</p>
    <p>- Yes, it is.</p>
    <p>Carol, hi! Okay.</p>
    <p>Yes, it is.</p>
    <p>I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age.</p>
    <p>- Can I stay? - No.</p>
    <p>- Hi.</p>
    <p>- Hi.</p>
    <p>- Is this a bad time? - No, it's.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>the Stone Age.</p>
    <p>You look great.</p>
    <p>I hate that.</p>
    <p>Sorry.</p>
    <p>Thanks.</p>
    <p>You look good too.</p>
    <p>Well, you know, in here, anyone who.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>stands erect.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>- What's new? Still a - A lesbian? - I'm pregnant.</p>
    <p>- Pregnant.</p>
    <p>She didn't leave in such a hurry after all.</p>
    <p>This is the Three's Company episode with a misunderstanding.</p>
    <p>Then I've already seen this one.</p>
    <p>Are you through with that? Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.</p>
    <p>Whose ball of paper is this? Mine.</p>
    <p>I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it.</p>
    <p>So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead.</p>
    <p>She already fluffed that pillow.</p>
    <p>You already fluffed It's fine.</p>
    <p>I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition.</p>
    <p>Parents can be cruel about the flatness of a child's pillow.</p>
    <p>Relax, you do this every time.</p>
    <p>The place looks great.</p>
    <p>You got a lasagna here that looks good enough.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>to avoid touching.</p>
    <p>Monica? Hi! Monica, you're scaring me.</p>
    <p>I mean, you're all chaotic and twirly, you know? Not in a good way.</p>
    <p>Calm down.</p>
    <p>You don't see Ross getting twirly every time they come.</p>
    <p>That's because my parents think Ross can do no wrong.</p>
    <p>You see, he's "The Prince.</p>
    <p>" They had some big ceremony before I was born.</p>
    <p>- What? - Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.</p>
    <p>- Has anybody seen my engagement ring? - It's beautiful.</p>
    <p>Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! No, don't touch that.</p>
    <p>Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back.</p>
    <p>"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl that stomped on your heart.</p>
    <p>" Now I must return the ring without the ring.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>which makes it so much harder.</p>
    <p>Easy, we'll find it.</p>
    <p>Won't we? Look, it's gonna be okay.</p>
    <p>You'll give it back.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>- and we'll eat ice cream.</p>
    <p>- Okay.</p>
    <p>
      It's a pear-shaped diamond Any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you.
    </p>
    <p>- When did you have it last? - Doy, right before she lost it.</p>
    <p>You don't get a lot of "doy" these days.</p>
    <p>I know I had it this morning.</p>
    <p>
      I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with Dinah? - Oh, don't be mad.
    </p>
    <p>- You didn't.</p>
    <p>- Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
    <p>- I gave you one job! But look how straight those noodles are.</p>
    <p>That's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.</p>
    <p>I just can't do it.</p>
    <p>Boys? We're going in.</p>
    <p>Hi.</p>
    <p>- That is not a happy "hi.</p>
    <p>" - Carol's pregnant.</p>
    <p>I found it! What? Yeah.</p>
    <p>Do that for two hours, you might be where I am about now.</p>
    <p>That puts that whole pillow thing in perspective.</p>
    <p>
      How do you fit into this whole thing? Carol and Susan want me to be
      involved.
    </p>
    <p>But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.</p>
    <p>- It's totally up to me.</p>
    <p>- She is so great.</p>
    <p>I miss her.</p>
    <p>- What does she mean by "involved"? - Your job is done.</p>
    <p>And the most enjoyable.</p>
    <p>Phoebe, say something.</p>
    <p>They want me to go down to this sonogram thing.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>with them tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Remember when life was simpler.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>and she was just a lesbian? Those were the days.</p>
    <p>- What are you gonna do? - I have no idea.</p>
    <p>No matter what I do, I'm still gonna be a father.</p>
    <p>
      This is still ruined, right? Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.
    </p>
    <p>- What's that curry taste? - Curry.</p>
    <p>I think they're great.</p>
    <p>I really do.</p>
    <p>The big Lugwin had a thing for you.</p>
    <p>- They all had a thing for him.</p>
    <p>- Oh, Mom.</p>
    <p>
      Why is this girl going to call me? She just graduated, and she wants to be
      something in cooking or food.
    </p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>
      I told her you have a restaurant - I don't have, I work in a restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>- They don't have to know that.</p>
    <p>- Ross, help me with the spaghetti.</p>
    <p>- Yes.</p>
    <p>Oh, we're having spaghetti.</p>
    <p>That's easy.</p>
    <p>We were going to have lasagna.</p>
    <p>- I love lasagna.</p>
    <p>- We're not having it.</p>
    <p>Then why bring it up? He latches on.</p>
    <p>This will sound unbelievably selfish.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>
      but did you plan to bring up the baby/lesbian thing? It might take the
      heat off of me.
    </p>
    <p>That Rachel.</p>
    <p>We saw her parents at the club.</p>
    <p>They were not playing well.</p>
    <p>I won't say what they spent.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding.</p>
    <p>At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.</p>
    <p>- What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing.</p>
    <p>- It's an expression.</p>
    <p>- No, it's not.</p>
    <p>Don't listen to her.</p>
    <p>You've always been independent.</p>
    <p>Even when you were a chubby kid.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>and you had no friends, you were just fine.</p>
    <p>You'd read alone in your room.</p>
    <p>Your puzzles.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>People like Ross need to shoot for the stars.</p>
    <p>With his museum and his published papers.</p>
    <p>Others are satisfied with staying where they are.</p>
    <p>These people never get cancer.</p>
    <p>They're happy with what they have, content.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>like cows.</p>
    <p>Cows, Dad? She knows how much I love cows.</p>
    <p>I read about women trying to have it all, and I thank God.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>our "Harmonica" doesn't have that problem.</p>
    <p>- I'm telling you, you'll be fine.</p>
    <p>- Thank you, Daddy.</p>
    <p>Oh, so this does work.</p>
    <p>
      So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little
      anecdotes to share with the folks? Look, I realize you guys have been
      wondering.
    </p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>what exactly happened between Carol and me.</p>
    <p>And so, well, here's the deal.</p>
    <p>Carol's a lesbian.</p>
    <p>She lives with a woman named Susan.</p>
    <p>She's pregnant with my child.</p>
    <p>She and Susan are going to raise the baby.</p>
    <p>
      And you knew about this? Folks are really that bad? Well, you know, these
      people are pros.
    </p>
    <p>They know what they do.</p>
    <p>They take their time.</p>
    <p>They get the job done.</p>
    <p>They say that you can't change your parents.</p>
    <p>Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.</p>
    <p>Must pee.</p>
    <p>It's worse when you're twins.</p>
    <p>- You're a twin? - We don't speak.</p>
    <p>She's this high-powered, driven, career-type.</p>
    <p>- What does she do? - She's a waitress.</p>
    <p>- Identical? - People say we look alike.</p>
    <p>But I don't see it.</p>
    <p>You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.</p>
    <p>Chandler, as an only child, you don't have this.</p>
    <p>No, although I did have an imaginary friend.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>who my parents preferred.</p>
    <p>Hit the lights, please.</p>
    <p>How long was I in there? - I'm just cleaning up.</p>
    <p>- Oh, you need any help? Okay, sure.</p>
    <p>Thanks.</p>
    <p>Anyway.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>So you nervous about Barry tomorrow? A little.</p>
    <p>A lot.</p>
    <p>So, got any advice? You know, as someone who's recently been dumped.</p>
    <p>You may wanna steer clear of the word "dumped.</p>
    <p>" Chances are he's gonna be this broken shell of a man.</p>
    <p>You should try not to look too terrific.</p>
    <p>I know it'll be hard.</p>
    <p>Or I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring.</p>
    <p>And you can go with Carol and Susan to the ob-gyn.</p>
    <p>You've got Carol tomorrow.</p>
    <p>- When did it get so complicated? - Got me.</p>
    <p>- Remember being in high school? - Yeah.</p>
    <p>Didn't you think you'd meet someone.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>fall in love, and that'd be it? - Ross? - Yes.</p>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <p>Man, I never thought I'd be here.</p>
    <p>Me neither.</p>
    <p>Sorry I'm late.</p>
    <p>I got stuck at work.</p>
    <p>There was this big dinosaur thing.</p>
    <p>Anyway.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>Hi.</p>
    <p>- You remember Susan.</p>
    <p>- How could I forget? Hello, Susan.</p>
    <p>Good shake, good shake.</p>
    <p>So, we're just waiting for? - Dr.</p>
    <p>Oberman.</p>
    <p>- And is he? - She.</p>
    <p>- Of course, "she.</p>
    <p>
      " Is she familiar with our special situation? - Yes, and she's very
      supportive.
    </p>
    <p>- Okay, that's great.</p>
    <p>No, I'm Oh.</p>
    <p>Thanks.</p>
    <p>That opens my cervix.</p>
    <p>- Barry? - Come on in.</p>
    <p>- Are you sure? - It's fine.</p>
    <p>Robbie's gonna be here for hours.</p>
    <p>So, how are you doing? I'm.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>I'm okay.</p>
    <p>- You look great.</p>
    <p>- Yeah, well.</p>
    <p>Dr.</p>
    <p>Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.</p>
    <p>Be right there.</p>
    <p>Be back in a second.</p>
    <p>I dumped him.</p>
    <p>
      So, how's this all gonna work? The baby grows in a special place inside
      Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean, how's this gonna work, you know, with us? When important decisions
      have to be made? - Give me a "for instance.
    </p>
    <p>" - Well, I don't know.</p>
    <p>- How about with the baby's name? - Marlon.</p>
    <p>If it's a boy.</p>
    <p>Minnie, if it's a girl.</p>
    <p>As in "Mouse"? As in my grandmother.</p>
    <p>Still, you say "Minnie," you hear "Mouse.</p>
    <p>" How about.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>? How about Julia? - Julia.</p>
    <p>- We agreed on Minnie.</p>
    <p>We agreed we'd spend our lives together.</p>
    <p>Things change.</p>
    <p>Roll with the punches.</p>
    <p>I believe Julia's on the table? Sorry about that.</p>
    <p>So, what have you been up to? Oh, not much.</p>
    <p>- I got a job.</p>
    <p>- That's great.</p>
    <p>Why are you so tan? I went to Aruba.</p>
    <p>Oh, no.</p>
    <p>You went on our honeymoon alone? No.</p>
    <p>I went with.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>- Now, this may hurt.</p>
    <p>- Me? No.</p>
    <p>I went with Mindy.</p>
    <p>Mindy? My maid of honor, Mindy? Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.</p>
    <p>You got plugs! Careful.</p>
    <p>They haven't quite taken yet.</p>
    <p>And you got lenses.</p>
    <p>You hate sticking your finger in your eye.</p>
    <p>Not for her.</p>
    <p>Listen, I really wanted to thank you.</p>
    <p>Okay.</p>
    <p>A month ago, I wanted to hurt you more than I've ever wanted to.</p>
    <p>And I'm an orthodontist.</p>
    <p>You know, you were right.</p>
    <p>I thought we were happy.</p>
    <p>We weren't happy.</p>
    <p>But with Mindy.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>now I'm happy.</p>
    <p>- Spit.</p>
    <p>- What? Me.</p>
    <p>Anyway.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>I guess this belongs to you.</p>
    <p>Or maybe some day Mindy.</p>
    <p>Like she'd settle for that.</p>
    <p>Yeah, that's true.</p>
    <p>But I think it's a nice ring.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>and thank you for giving it to me.</p>
    <p>Thank you for giving it back.</p>
    <p>
      Hello! - Please, what's wrong with Helen? - Helen Geller? - I don't think
      so.
    </p>
    <p>- It's not gonna be Helen Geller.</p>
    <p>- Thank you.</p>
    <p>- No, I mean, it's not Geller.</p>
    <p>
      It'll be Helen Willick? No, actually, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>Wait a minute.</p>
    <p>Why is she in the title? It's my baby too.</p>
    <p>Really? I don't remember you making any sperm.</p>
    <p>And we all know what a challenge that is.</p>
    <p>- You two, stop it.</p>
    <p>- She gets a credit.</p>
    <p>I'm in there too.</p>
    <p>Helen Willick Bunch Geller? I think that borders on child abuse.</p>
    <p>Of course not.</p>
    <p>I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.</p>
    <p>See what he does? He knows no one's gonna say all those names.</p>
    <p>They'll call her Geller.</p>
    <p>He gets his way.</p>
    <p>
      My way? You think this is my way? Of all the ways I ever imagined this
      moment being.
    </p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>this is not my You know what? This is too hard.</p>
    <p>Knock, knock.</p>
    <p>How are we? Any nausea? - A little.</p>
    <p>- Just a little.</p>
    <p>I was wondering about the mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.</p>
    <p>- Lie back.</p>
    <p>- You know what? I'm gonna go.</p>
    <p>I don't think I can be involved in this family thing.</p>
    <p>- Oh, my God! - Look at that.</p>
    <p>I know.</p>
    <p>
      Well, isn't that amazing? What are we supposed to be seeing here? I don't
      know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>If you tilt your head and relax your eyes.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>it kind of looks like an old potato.</p>
    <p>
      Then don't do that, all right? Monica, what do you think? - Are you
      welling up? - No.
    </p>
    <p>- You are.</p>
    <p>You're welling up.</p>
    <p>- I'm not.</p>
    <p>- You're gonna be an aunt.</p>
    <p>- Oh, shut up.</p>
    <p>Hi, Mindy.</p>
    <p>Hi, it's Rachel.</p>
    <p>Yeah, I'm fine.</p>
    <p>I saw Barry today.</p>
    <p>Yeah, he told me.</p>
    <p>No, it's okay.</p>
    <p>Really, it's okay.</p>
    <p>I hope you two are very happy.</p>
    <p>I really do.</p>
    <p>And, Min, you know, if everything works out.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>and you guys get married and have kids.</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>
      I hope they have his hairline and your nose! That was a cheap shot, but I
      feel so much better now!
